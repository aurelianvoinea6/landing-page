            <h3>About The International</h3>
            <p class="info-TI">
              The International, often abbreviated as TI, is an annual
              tournament organized by Valve. In 2015 Valve increased their
              number of hosted events, founding the Dota Major Championships
              which incorporates The International into its structure. The
              International remains the biggest and most prestigious event on
              the Major Championship circuit. The first International was held
              in Cologne, Germany, during the trade show Gamescom, in order to
              unveil Dota 2 to worldwide audiences. It drew attention due to its
              staggering $1.6 million USD prize pool (with $1 million for the
              champion). 16 teams were invited to play for the title. In 2012
              The International moved to Seattle, Washington. The prize pool
              remained at $1.6 million USD. Only 14 teams were invited; two
              additional slots were awarded to the winners of regional
              qualifiers. Since 2013, the Dota 2 community has been able to
              contribute to the prize pool. The total prize of The International
              2013 grew to $2.8 million USD. The prize pool surpassed $10
              million in 2014 and $20 million in 2016. In 2018, after six years
              in Seattle, The International was held in Vancouver, Canada. In
              2019, The International was held in Shanghai, China, the prize
              pool surpassed $34 million, making it the largest prize pool for
              any single esports tournament until it was surpassed by The
              International 2020.
